# Pixeltetris
A Tetris game written from scratch in C++ using the SDL2 development library. Apart from the core gameplay, the project also includes some extra features like a ghost block to reduce misdrops, a simple main menu, and support for multiple resolutions. All sprites were created by me.

## Installation
If you just want to try the game on your Windows or Linux machine, go the [Releases](https://github.com/jumpmanmv/pixeltetris/releases) page and get the latest executable.
- For Windows you may need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) if you don't have them already installed.
- For Linux you need to install g++, and the SDL2, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_image runtime libraries, which should be easily found in your distribution's repository. For Debian-based systems, use:
```
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0
sudo apt install libsdl2-image-2.0-0
```
## Build Instructions
This is the first project where I use CMake to support multiple OSes and compilers, so to compile the game yourself you will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/overview/).

### Windows
- First of all you need Visual Studio to compile the game. I have only compiled with [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), but I assume that other versions work as well.
- Clone the repository to your machine using Visual Studio.
- You will also need the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL_ttf 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/), and [SDL_image 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) development libraries. Make sure to download the versions denoted with "Visual C++". Extract all zip files to the root directory of the repository you cloned.
- Open the project folder with Visual Studio.
- Select CMakeLists.txt in the root of the project to compile.
- You may need to change the *Build root* option in CMakeSettings.json from *${projectDir}\out\build\${name}* to *${projectDir}\build\${name}*, so that the font loads correctly.

### Linux
- Firstly, install the g++ compiler using a command like *sudo apt install g++* or *sudo dnf install gcc-g++*. Then, install CMake using a command like *sudo apt install cmake* or *sudo dnf install cmake*.
- You will also need the SDL2, SDL_ttf and SDL_image libaries. Install them on Debian-based systems by running:
```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev
```
or on Fedora-based systems by running:
```
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel
sudo dnf install SDL2_ttf-devel
sudo dnf install SDL2_image-devel
```
- Clone the repository to your PC.
- Open a terminal window in the root directory of the cloned repository and run these commands one by one:
```
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cd build
make
```
You will then find the Pixeltetris executable in build.

### MacOS
I do not have a MacOS machine so I cannot test any builds for that OS. However, the process of compilation should not be very different from that in Linux, since the CMake find files work in all OSes.

## Controls
- Left/Right/Down arrow keys: Move the tetromino
- Up arrow key: Rotate the tetromino
- Space: Hard drop tetromino
- Shift/C: Swap with hold block
- P: Pause the game
- Q/Esc: Go back

## Features to add
- ~~Create sprites for all objects~~
- ~~Add a hold block~~
- ~~Add a ghost block (the outline that shows the position of the piece if dropped)~~
- ~~Add a simple menu~~
- ~~Add an options menu~~
- ~~Add support for multiple resolutions~~
- ~~Add a pause menu~~
- ~~All done!~~

## Third party tools
- [SDL2 framework](https://www.libsdl.org/) to handle all the low-level stuff
- [SDL_ttf 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) for rendering fonts
- [SDL_image 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) for loading images
- The fonts I use are called [Munro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/munro)
- [CMake scripts](https://github.com/tcbrindle/sdl2-cmake-scripts) to find SDL2, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image

## Acknowledgements
[Lazy Foo's SDL tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) have been extremely helpful, look into them if you are interested in low-level game programming or just want a framework to handle basic graphics for your C/C++ programs.

[An Introduction to Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/) is great for learning the basics of CMake and avoiding bad practices.

[Javier Lopez's Tetris tutorial](https://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/#comments) was my initial inspiration for starting this project. I also use the same tricks he uses to make the management of the pieces and their rotations easier.
